/**
 * JavaFX Application class that integrates with Spring Boot dependency injection.
 * 
 * <p>This class extends JavaFX's {@link Application} class and serves as the bridge
 * between the JavaFX application lifecycle and Spring-managed components. It handles
 * the initialization, startup, and shutdown phases of the desktop UI.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The application lifecycle follows this sequence:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #init()} - Retrieves the Spring context</li>
 *   <li>{@link #start(Stage)} - Initializes and displays the main UI</li>
 *   <li>{@link #stop()} - Performs cleanup when application closes</li>
 * </ol></p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> This class is designed to be used by JavaFX's
 * Application Thread and should not be instantiated directly.</p>
